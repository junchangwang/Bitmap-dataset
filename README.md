This repository contains the bitmap instances used to evaluate our bitmap indexes. **Please note that** this repository is an optional resource for accelerationâ€”all datasets and bitmap indexes can be generated using the provided scripts in the main bitmap index project. This repository is intended only for those who wish to skip the generation process.

The directory Synthetic/ contains the bitmap instances used to generate Figures 7 and 8 (core figures).

The directory TPCH-10SF/ contains the bitmap instances used to evaluate our bitmap indexes under TPC-HC workloads (SF = 10).
